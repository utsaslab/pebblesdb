## PebblesDB

PebblesDB is a write-optimized key-value store which is built using
the novel FLSM (Fragmented Log-Structured Merge Tree) data
structure. FLSM is a modification of the standard log-structured merge tree data structure which
aims at achieving higher write throughput and lower write
amplification without compromising on read throughput.

PebblesDB is built by modifying
[HyperLevelDB](https://github.com/rescrv/HyperLevelDB) which, in turn,
is built on top of
[LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb). PebblesDB is API
compatible with HyperLevelDB and LevelDB. Thus, PebblesDB is a
*drop-in* replacement for LevelDB and HyperLevelDB. The full paper on
PebblesDB can be found
[here](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/papers/sosp17-pebblesdb.pdf
"PebblesDB SOSP'17"). The slides for the SOSP 17 talk, which explains the core ideas behind PebblesDB, can be found [here](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/papers/pebblesdb-sosp17-slides.pdf). 

If you are using LevelDB in your deployment, do consider trying out
PebblesDB! PebblesDB can also be used to replace RocksDB as long as
the RocksDB-specific functionality like column families are not used.

The [benchmarks
page](https://github.com/utsaslab/pebblesdb/blob/master/benchmark.md)
has a list of experiments evaluating PebblesDB vs LevelDB,
HyperLevelDB, and RocksDB. The summary is that PebblesDB outperforms
the other stores on write throughput, equals other stores on read
throughput, and incurs a penalty for small range queries on fully
compacted key-value stores. PebblesDB achieves **6x** the write throughput of RocksDB, while providing similar read throughput, and performing 50% lesser IO. Please see the paper for more details.

### Dependencies

PebblesDB requires `libsnappy` and `libtool`. To install on Linux, please use
`sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev libtool`. For MacOSX, use `brew install snappy` and instead of `ldconfig`, use `update_dyld_shared_cache`.

PebblesDB was built, compiled, and tested with g++-4.7, g++-4.9, and g++-5. It may not work with other versions of g++ and other C++ compilers. 

### Installation

Using Autotools:

```
$ cd pebblesdb/src
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
$ ldconfig
```

Using CMake:

```shell
$ mkdir -p build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make install -j16
```

### Running microbenchmark
1. `cd pebblesdb/src/`
2. `make db_bench`  
3. `./db_bench --benchmarks=<list-of-benchmarks> --num=<number-of-keys> --value_size=<size-of-value-in-bytes> --reads=<number-of-reads> --db=<database-directory-path>`  
A complete set of parameters can be found in `db/db_bench.cc`  

Sample usage:  
`./db_bench --benchmarks=fillrandom,readrandom --num=1000000 --value_size=1024 --reads=500000 --db=/tmp/pebblesdbtest-1000`

### Optimizations in PebblesDB

PebblesDB uses the FLSM data structure to logically arrange the sstables
on disk. FLSM helps in achieving high write throughput by reducing
write amplification. But in FLSM, each guard can contain multiple
overlapping sstables. Hence a read or seek over the database requires
examining one guard (multiple sstables) per level, thereby increasing
the read/seek latency. PebblesDB employs some optimizations to tackle
these challenges as follows:

#### Read optimization

* PebblesDB makes use of sstable-level bloom filter instead of block
  level bloom filter used in HyperLevelDB or LevelDB. With this
  optimization, even though a guard can contain multiple sstables,
  PebblesDB effectively reads only one sstable from disk per level.

* By default, this optimization is turned on, but this can be disabled
  by commenting the macro `#define FILE_LEVEL_FILTER` in
  `db/version_set.h`. Remember to do `make db_bench` after making a
  change.

#### Seek optimization

Sstable-level bloom filter can't be used to reduce the disk read for
`seek` operation since `seek` has to examine all files within a guard
even if a file doesn't contain the key. To tackle this challenge,
PebblesDB does two optimizations:

1. **Parallel seeks:** PebblesDB employs multiple threads to do
`seek()` operation on multiple files within a guard. Note that this
optimization might only be helpful when the size of the data set is
much larger than the RAM size because otherwise the overhead of thread
synchronization conceals the benefits obtained by using multiple
threads.  By default, this optimization is disabled. This can be
enabled by uncommenting `#define SEEK_PARALLEL` in `db/version_set.h`.

2. **Forced compaction:** When the workload is seek-heavy, PebblesDB
can be configured to do a seek-based forced compaction which aims to
reduce the number of files within a guard. This can lead to an
increase in write IO, but this is a trade-off between write IO and
seek throughput.  By default, this optimization is enabled. This can
be disabled by uncommenting `#define DISABLE_SEEK_BASED_COMPACTION` in
`db/version_set.h`.

### Tuning PebblesDB

* The amount of overhead PebblesDB has for read/seek workloads as well
  as the amount of gain it has for write workloads depends on a single
  parameter: `kMaxFilesPerGuardSentinel`, which determines the maximum
  number of sstables that can be present within a single guard.

* This parameter can be set in `db/dbformat.h` (default value:
  2). Setting this parameter high will favor write throughput while
  setting it lower will favor read/seek throughputs.
