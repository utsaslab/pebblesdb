Sentinels
=========
We want sentinels away from the guards as much as possible.
It could just be a feature of each level in a version.

Inserting into sentinels:
insert if there are no guards
insert if largest < first guard.

Search sentinels:
If the interval overlaps the left of the first guard, check in
sentinel guard.

As usual, when a new guard is inserted, it takes some of the files
from the guard to the left. This might be sentinel also.

Sentinels participate in compaction just like regular guards.

Saving and restoring guards:
When a file is added into the manifest, adding an extra line for
indicating it belongs to a sentinel shouldn't cost much anyway.

Read the manifest and restore, just like VersionEdits from
LogAndApply.
